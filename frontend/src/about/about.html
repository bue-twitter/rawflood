    <h3>
      Why are there no fees or limits on what can be bought and sold?
    </h3>
    <p>
      There isn’t an organization, company, or individual managing OpenBazaar so there’s nobody to pay. The system works by allowing individuals to connect to each other to buy and sell goods without a middleman. The terms and conditions of each individual listing is up to the vendor, they will vary from one person to the next.
